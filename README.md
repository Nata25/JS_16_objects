# JS Objects & Prototypes

Practicing objects and prototypes in JavaScript. Trainee work.

A short 'story' is printed to the console demonstrating how objects are declared, how to change their properties, 
how to set and use a prototype to an object. 

A prototype is initialized via `{}` notation, while child classes are declared as constructor functions.
